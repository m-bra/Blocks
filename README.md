BLOCKS
======

blocks - a game with blocks!


### COMPILE

First, you need to preinstall, which downloads all the dependencies of this project.

 * On Debian, Ubuntu or other Debian-based: run preinstall-debian.sh
 * On Mac: Not supported yet :( (but soon!)
 * On Windows: Switch to Linux, dude
 * On BSD: Just kidding!

If your OS is not supported yet, you have to install the dependencies by yourself, which are CMake and a C++ Compiler (for compiling, obviously) and the dependencies of SFML (more info [here](http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials.php)).

### PLAY

Just go around with W A S D,  
Left click to take a block, right click to place it.  
It's so simple.  

Oh, and don't be afraid of the red screen at the beginning - it is my super cool and not crappy loading screen, I have been working so hard on it so I hope you like it!
