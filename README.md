BLOCKS
======

blocks - a game with blocks!


### COMPILE

This project uses CMake as build system.

If you're on UNIX:
    mkdir build  
    cd build  
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..  
    make && make install  

If you're on Windows:  
    switch to Linux, dude!

You have to install the following libraries by yourself:  
  * BulletPhysics
  * SFML
  * GLEW
  * (OpenGL, GLU)
  * (pthread)

### PLAY

Just go around with W A S D,  
Left click to take a block, right click to place it.  
It's so simple.
